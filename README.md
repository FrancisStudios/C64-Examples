IMPORTANT: this project is for educational purposes. You can compile and run, 
modify and do whatever you like with the example code.

The code can be assembled with Kick Assembler https://theweb.dk/KickAssembler but if you only want to test,
I included the .prg executable files that you can insert into an emulator or write to cassettes, 
floppies or whatever that makes you happy :)
